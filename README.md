# React-Snake-Game
## Rules
Nothing hard. Just try to eat (touch by head) the apples that appear on the map. 1 eaten apple = 1 point, bul also it makes your snake's body longer.
More points = better score. The game, however, can be won by eating enough apples to physically occupy the entire map. If you do, you are a true grandmaster.
You lose when you hit your head on the end of the map or your own body.

## Controls
You can control the snake with the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D keys.
